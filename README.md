# Soil and Crop Disease Analysis System

## Project Overview

This project aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals by analyzing soil data and providing insights on the necessary fertilizers and treatments for diseased crops. The system uses machine learning models to predict the ideal fertilizer based on soil composition and identifies appropriate actions for managing crop diseases. The ultimate goal is to enhance crop health and improve farm yield efficiency.

Features
Soil Analysis: Input soil data such as pH, moisture, and nutrient content to receive fertilizer recommendations.
Crop Disease Detection: Upload crop images or data related to plant health to identify potential diseases and suggest corrective measures.
Fertilizer Suggestions: The system analyzes soil nutrient deficiencies and suggests suitable fertilizers.
Disease Management: Based on the identified crop diseases, the system provides actionable advice for treatment or prevention.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following tools and libraries installed:

- Python 3.8+ (Python 3.10 recommended for compatibility with TensorFlow)
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- EasyOCR
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Dash (for the web application interface)
- Dash Bootstrap Components

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Hardware Requirements

For GPU-based processing (optional for faster computation, especially for disease detection):
- NVIDIA CUDA-compatible GPU
- Properly configured CUDA and cuDNN libraries

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd soil-crop-disease-analysis
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Windows, use `.\env\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Usage
Soil Data Input
Navigate to the "Soil Analysis" section of the application.
Enter the following soil data:
pH Level
Nutrient Content (N, P, K)
Moisture Level
Submit the form to receive fertilizer recommendations.
Crop Disease Detection
Upload an image of the affected crop in the "Disease Detection" section.
The system will analyze the image and provide insights about the disease, along with suggested remedies.
